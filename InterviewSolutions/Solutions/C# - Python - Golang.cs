For "What do you like most about each language":
Python:
Exceptional readability and clean syntax ("Pythonic" code)
Rich ecosystem of scientific/data analysis libraries (NumPy, Pandas, etc.)
Rapid prototyping and development speed
Great for scripting and automation

Golang:
Built-in concurrency support with goroutines and channels
Fast compilation and execution
Static typing with clean error handling
Excellent for building microservices and network applications

C#:
Robust type system and LINQ for elegant data operations
Excellent IDE support and debugging tools
Strong integration with the .NET ecosystem
Great balance of OOP features and modern functional concepts

Core differences:
Type System:
Python: Dynamic typing, duck typing
Golang: Static typing, minimal type inference
C#: Static typing with extensive type inference and generics

Memory Management:
Python: Garbage collected, abstracted memory management
Golang: Garbage collected but with more direct memory control
C#: Garbage collected with optional unsafe code blocks

Concurrency Model:
Python: Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) limits true parallelism
Golang: Built-in goroutines and channels for concurrent programming
C#: Async/await pattern with Task Parallel Library

Primary Use Cases:
Python: Data science, automation, web backends, scripts
Golang: Systems programming, network services, cloud infrastructure
C#: Enterprise applications, game development (Unity), Windows apps
